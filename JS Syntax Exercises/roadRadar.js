// Write a function that determines whether a driver is within the speed limit.
// You will receive the speed and the area. Each area has a different limit:
// 路 On the motorway, the limit is 130 km/h
// 路 On the interstate, the limit is 90 km/h
// 路 In the city, the limit is 50 km/h
// 路 Within a residential area, the limit is 20 km/h
// If the driver is within the limits,
// there should be a printed speed and the speed limit.
// `Driving {speed} km/h in a {speed limit} zone`
// If the driver is over the limit, however,
//  your function should print the severity of the infraction and the difference in speeds.
// `The speed is {difference} km/h faster than the allowed speed
//  of {speed limit} - {status}`
// For speeding up to 20 km/h over the limit, the status should be speeding.
// For speeding up to 40 km/h over the limit, the status should be excessive speeding.
// For anything else, status should be reckless driving.
// The input comes as 2 string parameters. 
// The first element is the current speed (number), the second element is the area.
// The output should be printed on the console.
